# Great!! You made it to the last project of this course. 

## PROJECT 7: Fully Responsive HealthCare Website.
This project would incoporate virtually everything you've learned so far, with a subtle introduction to CSS functions and some added javascript objects.

# What are CSS Functions?
CSS functions are used as a value for various CSS properties 

The two CSS Functions covered in this project are: 
- 1.) The var() function: variables declared in the :root selector can easily be reused all through your code using var() making your code easier to read and to maintain.

- 2.) The clamp() function: This is used extensively for fluid typography by setting a min value, a mid value and a max value for font-sizes. It can also be used for widths, heights, etc. It essentially "clamps" the values of properties within specified boundaries

*❔😕 If any of these definitions above ☝️ seems a little bit tricky for you, it's totally fine. You'd get to understand it better as you go through the code😇*

# Requisite Javascript Knowledge
- 1.) The arrow function syntax: () =>
- 2.) The event object: (e) => 
- 3.) Target event property
- 4.) HTML DOM matches() method.
- 5.) HTML DOM closest() method.
- 6.) If statements
- 7.) Comparison Operators 
    a.) == (equals to)
    b.) != (not equals to)
    c.) && (and)
    d.) || (or)
    e.) > (greater than)
    f.) < (less than)
    g.) >= (greater than or equal to)
    h.) <= (less than or equal to)

# In this project, you will
- 1.) Use clamp() function to implement fluid typography for different screen sizes.
- 2.) Learn how to remove nav card when you click anywhere outside the navcard
- 3.) Declare CSS variables using the var() function
- 4.) Learn about browser support for different CSS properties

ℹ️ Some extra notes are provided about some CSS properties and functions in the comments section of style sheet. Go ahead, if you wish, and read through them for better understanding of the project.*
