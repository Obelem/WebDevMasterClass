## PROJECT 4: Introduction to Layouts (Position Property)
The position property, although not naturally flexible in itself, can still be used together with the flexbox and other responsive displays to create great and flexible layouts.

There are `five` different position values; but this project covers just the use of two of them; the `relative` and `absolute` positioning. 
Others `(static, fixed and sticky)` however would be covered in the course of the tutorial.

*There's a script.js file in the js folder. Not to worry if you don't understand what's going on there, only focus on replicating the design with the responsive layout techniques you've learned so far. We'll get to basic javascript very soon.*


I advise you slowly go through the project and note any questions you may have.
If you find any code block mysterious 😄lol, you can reach me before the next class. I'd be willing to help. 😇


**Happy Coding🚀 and Remember, Jesus loves you!!**
