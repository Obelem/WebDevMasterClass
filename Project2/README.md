## PROJECT TWO: Introduction to CSS Layouts (Floats)
So basically, this tutorial is designed to help us
see the need for responsive designs.


In view of this, we would build a home page with the css `float property` for desktop view and try resizing the screen to see how the layout flows with it.

- Notice how the layout gets disoriented at smaller screen sizes making it unsuitable to be used as the primary technique in designing of layouts especially in a time when about 68.1% of the internet is accessed via mobile devices.

**N/B: Floats however are not entirely useless; but using it as the base tech in designing websites in this age is certainly obsolete**

# How to load the page
There are two `basic` ways of viewing the page:
- By clicking on the the `index.html` file in the folder.
- By opening the Project 1 folder on VS Code and starting it using the live server extension `(Recommended)`.

**Using the live server has the advantage that your page automatically gets refreshed each time you save your file. This makes your work a lot more easier**

Alright! So much has been said already, now go have some fun.

**Happy CodingðŸš€ and Remember, Jesus loves you!!**
