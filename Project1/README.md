## PROJECT ONE: Introduction to HTML and CSS
- 1.) HTML ðŸ‘‡
      H: Hyper
      T: Text
      M: Markup
      L: Language
    HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points or using images and data tables.

- 2.) CSS
      C: Cascading 
      S: Style
      S: Sheets
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.

Essentially, `HTML` gives us what to be displayed in a specified order while `CSS` helps us style the content which has been provided in the HTML.
ðŸ’¡**So, HTML makes the raw content available while CSS beautifies the raw content to make it presentable to the end users.**
