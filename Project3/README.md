# Greetings! Great to see you're still excited about web dev 🤔 🤩;

## PROJECT THREE: Introduction to Responsive Layouts using:
# a.) FlexBox;
# b.) Media Queries 🧑‍💻;
# c.) Relative Units (Fluid Typography)

In our last project, we saw the short comings of the float
property and the need for responsive layouts.

So now, we'd be delving into the world of responsive designs using CSS flexbox, CSS Media Queries and relative units.

Responsive design has two primary approaches:
- i.) Desktop First Approach 🖥️: which means you design the desktop view first, then you scale down to tablet and mobile screens 
- ii.) Mobile First Approach 📱: which means you start from the mobile view and scale up to tablet and desktop screens.

**This tutorial uses the `desktop first approach`, not because it is essentially better, but simply a matter of choice..**





**Happy Coding 🚀 and Remember, Jesus Loves You!!**
