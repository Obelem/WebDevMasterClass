## PROJECT 6: Introduction to Javascript DOM.
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è DOM means: Document Object Model.

In all our previous designs, at smaller screen sizes, there was always this cluster of links on the nav bar, making it less appealing to the sight.

To remedy this, we'd be incoporating a navigation card to our design at smaller screen sizes using some added css techniques and basic javascript DOM manipulation.

# Added CSS Knowledge
- transform property. *Emphasis on the translateX() value*
- overflow property
- opacity property
- How to import google icons.

# Requisite Javascript Knowledge
- querySelector() method
- Named functions
- Event Listeners
- HTML DOM ClassList Property

*Extra information about the javascipt code is given as comments in the script.js file. Endeavour to read them while coding to get tips and best practices*
